                For the broth, char the onion and ginger over a naked flame for 10-15 minutes or until blackened. Alternatively, roast them under a hot oven grill. Transfer the onion and ginger to a chopping board and scrape off most of the blackened skins. Lightly rinse the onion and ginger and then roughly chop. Set aside for later.

                Place the beef bones in a large stockpot (at least 6L capacity). Pour over enough water to generously cover the beef. Bring to a boil and simmer for a minute or so. Then remove the bones from the water (there should be quite a bit of scum at the surface). Rinse the bones. Discard the water and clean the stock pot. Place the bones back into the clean stockpot along with the peeled onion, ginger, star anise, cloves and cinnamon stick. Add 5L of water. Bring to a simmer and cook gently for 2 hours, skimming the surface every so often.
